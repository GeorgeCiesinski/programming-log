- Fixed typo in main function "createPaletteFromColor" which had Palette spelled "Pallete"
- Created [pull request](https://github.com/bartbergmans/Palettey/pull/4)
- Resolved high severity vulnerability alert
- Noticed that fix broke Jest. Attempted to resolve this but discovered that Jest has a known issue loading Modules. 
- Opened up a new issue on Palettey describing the issue
