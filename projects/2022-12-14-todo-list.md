- Created boilerplate
- Installed webpack and required loaders
- Installed esLint, Prettier, and config files for both
- Decided to create a project skeleton for future projects
- Got stuck with setting up esLint/Prettier to work well together
- Opened a suggestion/bug on TheOdinProject discord page to address the issue with the Linter lesson
- Researched online to search for a solution
